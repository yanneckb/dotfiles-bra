## Installation

1. **Clone the repository into your `$HOME` directory:**

```sh
git clone git@github.com:yanneckb/dotfiles-bra.git ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
```

2. **Symlink the configuration files using GNU Stow:**

```sh
stow .
```

- To adopt existing files (warning: this will overwrite your current shell configuration):
  ```sh
  stow --adopt .
  ```
- To remove all symlinks created by Stow:
  ```sh
  stow -D .
  ```

**Tip:** You can stow only specific modules, e.g.:
```sh
stow zsh
stow nvim
```

---

## Backup & Restore
- Before running `stow --adopt`, consider backing up your existing dotfiles.
- To update your dotfiles, pull the latest changes and re-run `stow`.

---

## Customization
- Feel free to fork and adapt these dotfiles to your own workflow.
- Add your own modules in `.config/` and manage them with Stow.
